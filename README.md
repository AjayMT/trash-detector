# Trash Detector

Our project utilizes a neural network to detect objects that are commonly trash found in classrooms and lecture halls
  * Can detect water bottles, plates, and other common forms of trash
  * Web application that allows users to upload images and check for items of trash using our neural network and openCV's YOLO machine vision

## Usage
  * Can be setup inside of a classroom security camera to detect when garbage is left in the room and to notify custodial staff
    * Can be further setup to work in national parks and other places where trash can typically be found to further protect the environment
  
## Build/Installation Instructions
  * Requires pip installation
    * Keras, numpy, tensorflow, flask, PIL
  * Python 3.6
